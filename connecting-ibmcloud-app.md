# Connecting an  application
{: #ibmcloud-app}

Applications running in  can be bound to your NaN deployment.

## Connecting a Kubernetes Service application
{: #connect-kubernetes}

To connect a Cloud databases deployment to a Kubernetes Service application, follow these two steps. First, bind your deployment to your cluster and store its connection strings in a secret. The second step is configuring your application to use the connection strings.

The sample app in the [Connecting a Kubernetes Service Tutorial](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=cloud-databases-tutorial-k8s-app) provides a sample application that uses Node.js and demonstrates how to bind the sample application to a NaN deployment.

Before connecting your Kubernetes Service application to a deployment, ensure that the deployment and cluster are in the same region and resource group.

### Binding your deployment
{: #bind-deployment}

**Public Endpoints** - If you are using the default public service endpoint to connect to your deployment, run the `cluster service bind` command with your cluster name, the resource group, and your deployment name.

```sh
ibmcloud ks cluster service bind <your_cluster_name> <resource_group> <your_database_deployment>
```

**Private Endpoints** - If you want to use a private endpoint (if one is enabled on your deployment), create a service key for Kubernetes to use when binding to the database. Then, bind the database to the Kubernetes cluster through the private endpoint with the `cluster service bind` command.

```sh
ibmcloud ks cluster service bind <your_cluster_name> <resource_group> <your_database_deployment> --key <your-private-key>
```

### Verifying the secret
{: #verify-secret}

To verify that the Kubernetes secret was created in your cluster namespace, run the following command and look for the API key for accessing the instance of your deployment that is provisioned in your account.

```sh
kubectl get secrets --namespace=default
```

More information on binding services is found in the [Kubernetes Service documentation](/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-binding#bind-services).

### Configuring in your Kubernetes app
{: #configure-kubernetes}

When you bind your application to Kubernetes Service, it creates an environment variable from the cluster's secrets. Your deployment's connection information lives in `BINDING` as a JSON object. Load and parse the JSON object into your application to retrieve the information your application's driver needs to make a connection to the database.

The [Connection Strings](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-connection-strings#connection-string-breakdown) page contains a reference of the JSON fields.

For more information, see the [Kubernetes Service docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-binding#reference_secret).

The changes made include:

1. Correcting the spelling error \"Postresql\" to \"Postgresql\" in the first line.
2. Adding a period (.) at the end of the screen and codeblock examples.
3. Adding a space after the hash sign (#) in the headings for better readability.
